# U-Net: medical imaging segmentation 

## Overview of the Project:

The TumorSeg Computer Vision Project is dedicated to Semantic Segmentation, which involves classifying every pixel in an image as part of a tumor or non-tumor region. This fine-grained approach provides an accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of tumors within medical images.

[U-Net Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf ) implemented in Pytorch was used to perform brain tumor segmentation. The model was trained and tested on the Google Colab platform in order to use GPU computation.

The Dataset was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/brain-tumor-image-dataset-semantic-segmentation). there is one class with two category_id 1 and 2. but both is belong to one class. 

Here is the distribution of each subset respectively(train, validation and test)
