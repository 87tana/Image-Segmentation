# U-Net: medical imaging segmentation   

## The UNet Architecture

U-Net is a convolutional NN architecture widely used for tasks like image segmentation. The U-Net was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation.The shape reflects its method, it is a fully convolutional network consisting of an **encoder** that learns to **downsample the input image** while preserving spatial information, and a **decoder** that learns to **upsample** the feature maps to the original image size while incorporating the encoder features.
