##Objective: Performing segmentation analysis on magnetic resonance images of brain tumours.

## Dataset feature Extraction and DataFrame creation
Data set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats2020-training-data/data

This repository include a Python script that facilitates the extraction of important features from JSON files containing annotations and images in a dataset. The extracted features are used to create a structured DataFrame for easier data manipulation and analysis.

Extracted Features

The extracted features include:

    File names of images
    Dimensions (width and height) of images
    Category IDs associated with annotations
    Segmentation data for annotations
    Subset information (train, valid, test)
