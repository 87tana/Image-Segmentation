* ### Dataset

The dataset was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/brain-tumor-image-dataset-semantic-segmentation), compromise a single class with two category IDs, 1 and 2. Despite this distinction, both categories belong to the same class.

* ### Data Augumentation

The basic forms of data augmentation are used here to diversify the training data. All the augmentation methods are used from Pytorch's Torchvision module.
* ### Loss Function

* ### Experiment with different backbone


* ### Training Process and Validation loss
